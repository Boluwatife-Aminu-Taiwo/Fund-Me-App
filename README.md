# Acknowledgements

I want to use this to solidify my stance on the road to being a great Web3 developer. I want to thank [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC) and FreeCodeCamp for giving a free tutorial on being a web3 developer. It has been a great journey thus far. I hope to make it to the end. ðŸ˜‡
